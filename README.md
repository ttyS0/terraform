# Terraform

The vast majority of my Terraform activity takes place in private repositories for work, and is mostly centered around AWS. I only have a handful of AWS things in my personal acocunts, so the AWS content will tend to be sparse here. Mostly this is a place for me to play around with other providers such as Vault and Kubernetes.
